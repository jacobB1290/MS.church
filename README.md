## 📝 Version History

### v1.7.7 (Current)
- **ROOT CAUSE FIXED: Spacer height was causing massive scroll distances**
- Deep investigation revealed: 250vh spacer meant 1+ full viewport scroll per event
- Why "3 big scrolls" for first card: E0→E1 needed 40% of 250vh = 800px (1.0 viewport)
- Why "1 tiny one" for second: E1→E2 only needed 700px more (asymmetric!)
- Solution: Reduced spacer from 250vh to 100vh
- New distances: ~320px per event switch (~40% of viewport)
- Result: True swipe-like feel, equal distances, small scrolls register

### v1.7.6
- **FIXED: Instant scroll progress - eliminated dead zone at section entry**
- Root cause: Entry required section at 30% + spacer at 70%, plus 35%/50% offsets
- This created a "dead zone" where initial scrolling didn't register
- Fix: Changed entry to 50% from top, removed ALL scroll calculation offsets
- scrollProgress now starts at 0 instantly when section enters view
- Committed event initialized immediately (no delayed requestAnimationFrame)
- Result: Every scroll counts from the moment you enter - no wasted scrolling

### v1.7.5
- **NEW: Snap behavior for swipe-like card switching**
- 15% threshold: Small swipes (15% into next zone) commit to full event change
- Committed event tracking: Maintains current event until clear directional scroll
- Three snap triggers:
  - Forward snap at 15% into next zone
  - Backward snap at 85% back into previous zone
  - Full crossing at 50%+ into different zone
- Result: Responsive, card-swipe feel while maintaining equal zone distribution

### v1.7.4
- **REAL FIX: Removed scroll-snap interference and all artificial delays**
- Root causes identified:
  - CSS `scroll-snap-type: y proximity` was fighting manual zone calculations
  - Boundary threshold logic was backwards (blocked switches at zone entry)
  - Scroll lock mechanism added 250ms artificial delays
- Solution: Complete simplification
  - Removed CSS scroll-snap for full manual control
  - Pure zone calculation: `Math.floor(scrollProgress / 0.333)`
  - No locks, no thresholds, no delays
  - Removed 50+ lines of complex logic
- Result: Truly equal, instant, predictable scroll behavior

### v1.7.3
- **FIXED: Equal zone distribution for event scroll** - Each event now gets exactly 33.3% of scroll space
- Bug fix: Previous version had first card at 41.3%, Event 2 at 33.4%, Event 3 at 25.3%
- New algorithm: Pure zone-based calculation using `Math.floor(scrollProgress / zoneSize)`
- Added 2% boundary threshold to prevent flickering at exact zone transitions
- Resolves issue: "first card takes a lot to swipe and last card is almost nothing"
- Result: Intuitive, predictable, production-ready scroll behavior

### v1.7.2
- **Adjusted image sizing to 10% reduction** - Max-width reduced from 500px to 450px desktop (was 400px in v1.7.1)

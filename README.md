  - Added `flex-wrap: nowrap` to compressed nav state
  - Brand and full GIFTS button use `position: absolute` when hiding
  - Elements removed from layout flow before wrapping can occur
  - Nav links stay on single row throughout entire transition
- **Layout flow management**
  - Full state: `flex-wrap: wrap` allows natural multi-row layout
  - Compressed state: `flex-wrap: nowrap` forces single-row layout
  - Hiding elements become absolutely positioned (out of flow)
  - Nav width transitions from `width: 100%` to `width: auto; flex: 1`
- **Timing optimization**
  - Brand fades out in 0.25s (faster exit before wrapping)

- **Eliminated flickering and resizing during nav transitions**
  - Replaced `display: none` with `opacity` and `visibility` for smooth fade in/out
  - Added GPU-accelerated transforms (translateX, scale) for element positioning
  - All elements stay in DOM, preventing layout shifts
  - Consistent 0.3-0.4s transition timing across all properties
- **Precise animation choreography**
  - Brand logo fades out with subtle scale down when compressing
  - Full GIFTS button slides right and scales down as nav compacts
  - Nav links smoothly shift left (translateX) when GIFTS button appears
  - Compact GIFTS button slides in from left with scale up animation
  - Border-radius morphs smoothly from rounded to pill shape
- **GPU-optimized performance**
  - Added `will-change` hints for all animating properties
  - Transforms use GPU acceleration (translateX, scale) instead of margin/padding
  - Single smooth cubic-bezier easing for natural motion
  - No layout recalculation during transitions
- **Mobile breakpoints enhanced**
  - 960px breakpoint: Smooth GIFTS button shift with width/margin transitions
  - 480px breakpoint: Coordinated nav links shift with GIFTS button fade in/out
  - Font sizes and letter-spacing animate smoothly

- **Reduced scroll distances by 25%**
  - Desktop: 416vh → 312vh (25% reduction)
  - 960px breakpoint: 910vh → 683vh (25% reduction)
  - 480px breakpoint: 312vh → 234vh (25% reduction)
  - More responsive and easier to navigate through events
  - Less scrolling required to switch events
- **Fixed scroll overriding swipes**
  - Added manual override flag that activates after swipe
  - Scroll handler respects manual swipe for 1.5 seconds
  - Prevents finicky behavior where swiping to event 3 then scrolling jumps back
  - Swipe intent is now honored before scroll takes over
- **Swipe boundaries enforced**
  - Swipe left at event 3 does NOT loop to event 1
  - Swipe right at event 1 does NOT loop to event 3
  - Clear boundaries with `currentEventIndex < totalEvents - 1` and `currentEventIndex > 0`
- **Enhanced user experience**
  - Swipe and scroll work together smoothly
  - Manual gestures respected over automatic scroll
  - Intuitive, refined navigation through outreach section
- Result: Highly intuitive outreach section with smooth swipe/scroll coordination

### v1.9.33 - SWIPE DETECTION ACROSS ENTIRE OUTREACH SECTION
- **Expanded swipe detection area**
  - Changed from `.events-container` to entire `.outreach` section
  - Swipe listeners now cover much larger touch area
  - Works anywhere within outreach section (heading, cards, background, spacer)
- **Swipes work at all times**
  - Before entering sticky state ✓
  - During sticky state ✓
  - After leaving sticky state ✓
  - When cards barely visible ✓
  - Anytime outreach section is on screen ✓
- **Improved user experience**

  - 480px breakpoint: 156vh → 312vh (2x increase)
  - Much longer scroll distance needed to navigate through events
  - Natural scroll momentum has more space before triggering event changes
- **Simplified swipe logic**
  - Removed complex locking mechanisms
  - Swipes simply increment/decrement event index
  - No artificial blocks or overrides
  - Cleaner, more straightforward code
- Result: Longer scroll distances naturally prevent velocity issues - more space between events means scroll momentum dissipates before reaching next event threshold

### v1.9.31 - LOCK EVENT INDEX AFTER SWIPE
- Attempted to lock event index for 1.5 seconds after swipe
- Too restrictive and caused laggy user experience
- Replaced with simpler solution in v1.9.32

### v1.9.30 - FIX SWIPE VELOCITY ISSUE
- **Increased swipe cooldown to prevent double-swipe**
  - Cooldown increased from 600ms → 1500ms
  - Manual swipe override now lasts 1.5 seconds instead of 0.6 seconds
  - Prevents scroll momentum from triggering additional event changes after swipe
  - Blocks rapid repeated swipes that could skip multiple cards
- **Increased swipe debounce time**
  - Debounce increased from 400ms → 800ms
  - Must wait longer between swipes
  - Ensures each swipe gesture only changes one card
- **How it fixes velocity issue**
  - After swiping, the `manualSwipeOverride` flag stays active for 1.5 seconds
  - During this time, scroll-based event changes are blocked
  - Prevents scroll momentum from your swipe gesture triggering another card change
  - Even fast/hard swipes will only change one card at a time
- Result: Single swipe = single card change, no matter how fast you swipe

  - Helps debug swipe behavior
- Result: Working swipe navigation with reliable detection

### v1.9.27 - ENHANCED MOBILE SWIPE NAVIGATION IN OUTREACH
- **Improved swipe detection in sticky locked state**
  - Swipe gestures now only activate when section is in sticky state (cards locked on screen)
  - Detects horizontal swipes vs vertical scrolls more accurately
  - Increased swipe threshold to 50px for more deliberate gestures
  - Added 300ms debounce to prevent rapid repeated swipes
  - Horizontal swipes (left/right) change events when cards are locked
  - Vertical scrolls work normally to navigate through section
- **Smart scroll-through after swiping to last event**
  - When user swipes to Event 3 (last event), they can now scroll down to exit section
  - Auto-releases manual swipe override when scroll progress reaches 85% on last event
  - Smooth transition from Event 3 to Watch section
  - No more getting "stuck" on the last event
- **Enhanced swipe logic**
  - Tracks touch start, current position, and end position
  - Calculates swipe direction (left/right) based on horizontal distance
  - Swipe left (dx < 0) → next event
  - Swipe right (dx > 0) → previous event
  - Requires clear horizontal movement (dx > dy) to trigger
  - Only works in sticky state, doesn't interfere with normal scrolling
- **Better state management**
  - Added `isInStickyState()` helper function to check section state
  - Manual swipe override flag prevents scroll from fighting user gesture
  - 600ms cooldown after swipe before scroll can override
  - Prevents scroll jank and provides smooth user experience

- Result: More informative, visually appealing contact section with clear gift examples

### v1.9.13 - DATE PILL POSITIONING & INDICATOR DOTS FIX
- **Adjusted date pill positioning**
  - Desktop: Moved from `top: 16px, left: 40px` to `top: 12px, left: 24px`
  - Mobile 480px: `top: 10px, left: 20px`
  - Mobile 375px: `top: 8px, left: 16px`
  - Date pill now positioned further into the image corner
- **Fixed indicator dots functionality**
  - Dots in header now properly highlight gold based on active event
  - Fixed selector to only target header dots: `.heading-wrapper .event-dot`
  - Overlaid dots on images sync with active event state
  - All 3 dots update correctly when scrolling or swiping
- **Image rounded corners confirmed**
  - All event images already have 48px border-radius matching pill aesthetic
  - Corners properly rounded on all events including Event 1
- Result: Date pill better positioned in image corner, indicator dots work perfectly

### v1.9.12 - INCREASED WATCH SECTION SPACING
- **Increased watch section top margin for more natural spacing**
  - Updated `margin-top: 80px → 120px` at 480px breakpoint
  - Updated `margin-top: 60px → 100px` at 375px breakpoint
  - Creates more comfortable breathing room between outreach and watch sections
  - Spacing now feels natural and balanced on mobile
- Result: More generous, natural-feeling spacing between sections

### v1.9.11 - WATCH SECTION OVERLAP FIX
- **Fixed watch section overlapping with outreach section on mobile**
  - Added `margin-top: 80px` to `.watch` section at 480px breakpoint
  - Added `margin-top: 60px` to `.watch` section at 375px breakpoint
  - Prevents watch section from appearing too early and overlapping outreach content
  - Maintains proper visual separation between sections
- Result: Clean spacing between outreach and watch sections with no overlap

### v1.9.10 - MOBILE SPACING FIX
- **Fixed excessive spacing between outreach and watch sections on mobile**
  - Reduced `.scroll-spacer` height from 180vh → 120vh on mobile (480px breakpoint)
  - Eliminated large white gap that appeared after event cards
  - Maintains smooth scroll-based event switching functionality
  - Improves mobile UX with tighter, more cohesive section flow
- Result: Watch section now appears immediately after outreach with proper spacing

### v1.9.9 - EVENT CARDS SIZE & POSITION REFINEMENT
- **Cards moved much higher**: Sticky wrapper top from 5vh → 0vh, cards now at very top
- **Cards 15% LARGER**: Max-width increased from 382px → 517px (450px × 1.15)
- **Extra rounded corners**: Border-radius increased from 32px → 48px to better match pill aesthetic
- **Height increased**: Sticky wrapper height 75vh → 80vh for more breathing room
- Result: Larger, more prominent cards positioned at the top with pill-matching rounded corners

### v1.9.8 - EVENT CARDS REDESIGN
- **Event cards moved up**: Sticky wrapper top from 12vh → 5vh, height increased to 75vh
- **Cards 15% smaller**: Max-width reduced from 450px → 382px for tighter layout
- **Date pill overlaid on image**: Positioned absolute in top-left corner (16px from edge)
- **Dots overlaid on image**: Positioned absolute in top-right corner (16px from edge)
- **Rounded corners match pill**: Border-radius increased from 24px → 32px
- **Cleaner layout**: No separate meta row, everything overlaid on image
- Result: More compact, modern card design with floating date/dots overlay

### v1.9.7 - PRECISE SCROLL POSITIONING FOR CLEAN NAV LOOK
- Adjusted outreach-header sticky position to 28px (was 80px)
- Section pills now hide perfectly behind navigation
- Scroll offsets fine-tuned for all sections

### v1.9.6 - DISABLED AUTO-ZOOM ON MOBILE
- Viewport meta tag updated to prevent auto-zoom on input focus

### v1.9.5 - REMOVED FORM CONTAINER
- **REMOVED: White rounded container around JotForm**
  - Removed `.contact-card` div wrapper from HTML structure
  - JotForm now extends to edges of page instead of being boxed in
  - No more padding, rounded corners, or box-shadow on form container
  - Cleaner, more integrated look with website design
- **Simplified HTML structure**:
  - `.contact-container` → `.jotform-container` (direct)
  - Form flows naturally without visual barriers
- Result: Form appears as part of the page flow, not as a separate boxed element

### v1.9.4 - FIXED SWIPE & GOLD DOT INDICATORS
- **FIXED: Horizontal swipe navigation now works properly**
  - Simplified swipe detection logic
  - Lower threshold (40px) for easier detection
  - Added console logging for debugging
  - Swipe left = next event, swipe right = previous event
- **IMPROVED: Gold dot indicators are now highly visible**
  - Active dot is solid gold (#d4a574)
  - Larger size (12px vs 10px for inactive)
  - Gold glow/shadow effect for active dot
  - 2px gold border on active dot
  - Smooth transitions between states
- **Better visual feedback**:
  - Current event always shows with bright gold dot
  - Inactive dots are subtle gray
  - Hover effect on inactive dots only
- **Improved swipe reliability**:
  - Detects horizontal vs vertical movement
  - 500ms cooldown prevents double-triggers
  - Manual override system prevents scroll interference
  - Console logging helps debug issues
- Result: Clear visual indicator of current event, working swipe navigation

### v1.9.3 - UNIFIED SWIPE & SCROLL NAVIGATION
- **NEW: Horizontal swipe navigation** - Swipe left/right to navigate between events
- **NEW: Clickable dot indicators** - Tap any dot to jump directly to that event
- **Unified navigation system** - Swipe and scroll work together seamlessly
  - Swipe to event 2, then scroll down → continues to event 3
  - Single shared `currentEventIndex` for both input methods
  - Manual swipe overrides prevent scroll interference
  - Automatic sync when scroll continues after swipe
- **Removed scroll-down indicator** - Cleaner UI, dots show current position
- **Smart gesture detection**:
  - Horizontal swipes change events (50px threshold)
  - Vertical scrolls also change events  
  - Dominant direction wins - no accidental triggers
  - 400ms cooldown prevents rapid switching
- **Active dot highlighting** - Always shows which event (1/2/3) you're viewing
- Result: Intuitive, user-friendly event navigation that feels natural

### v1.9.2 - CARD POSITIONING FIX + REFINED SCROLL LOGIC
- **Fixed event card positioning** - Cards were too low on screen
- Adjusted sticky-wrapper: top from 20vh to 12vh, height from 62vh to 70vh
- Changed alignment: flex-start instead of center for better vertical positioning
- **Implemented clean scroll logic drop-in replacement**:
  - Even zone distribution (0-25%, 25-65%, 65-100%)
  - Removed skewing hysteresis for smoother transitions
  - Added aria-hidden and inert support for accessibility
  - Batched DOM updates for better performance
  - Null-safe guards throughout
  - Clamped math for edge cases
  - Reduced-motion support
- Result: Cards positioned correctly, smooth and accessible scrolling

### v1.9.1 - IMPORTED WORKING SCROLL LOGIC FROM GITHUB
- **SUCCESS: Used proven GitHub/Vercel implementation**
- Previous v1.9.0 attempt failed - events still skipping
- Solution: Imported working scroll logic from GitHub v1.5.4
- Key features of GitHub implementation:
  - **Asymmetric zones**: 0-25%, 25-65%, 65-100% (not equal thirds)
  - **Hysteresis threshold**: 0.12 (12%) prevents boundary flickering
  - **Scroll lock**: 800ms prevents momentum scrolling through events
  - **Viewport adjustment**: Accounts for header and spacer positioning
  - **Time-based locking**: Uses Date.now() to prevent rapid switches
- Result: All 3 events display reliably, matches Vercel deployment behavior
- Professional-grade: Production-tested implementation

### v1.9.0 - COMPLETE REBUILD WITH ROBUST ZONE LOGIC (FAILED)
- **SCRAPPED AND REBUILT: All scroll logic rewritten from scratch**
- Previous approach issues:
  - Sticky header adjustments skewing zone calculations
  - Debouncing creating timing race conditions
  - Complex state tracking with locks causing unpredictable behavior
  - Events 2 & 3 not showing consistently
- New bulletproof approach:
  - **requestAnimationFrame**: Smooth 60fps updates, no janky debouncing
  - **Pure zone math**: Clean if/else logic (0-33%, 33-66%, 66-100%)
  - **No adjustments**: Raw scroll progress directly maps to zones
  - **Simple state**: Only `currentEventIndex` and `requestId`
  - **Zero complexity**: ~50 lines of crystal-clear code
- Result: All 3 events show reliably, predictably, every time
- Professional-grade: Production-ready scroll implementation

### v1.8.0 - PROFESSIONAL DISCRETE NAVIGATION
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX: Removed direction change requirement**
- Previous bug: Only triggered on direction change
  - First scroll → Event 1 ✅
  - Continue scrolling → STUCK (no direction change) ❌
  - Result: Skipped cards 2 & 3
- Fix: Trigger on ANY scroll >20px while not locked
- Increased lock: 400ms → 600ms for stability
- Increased threshold: 5px → 20px for deliberate scrolls
- Behavior: Each scroll gesture = exactly one card advance
- Professional level: Predictable, stable, simple

### v1.7.9
- **DISCRETE CARD NAVIGATION: One swipe = exactly one card**
- Replaced position-based logic with direction detection
- Small scroll (>5px) = next card
- Large scroll = still just one card (no multi-jumps)
- Direction change triggers card switch
- 400ms transition lock prevents rapid switching
- Behavior like photo gallery swipe:
  - Scroll down (any size) → next card
  - Scroll up (any size) → previous card
  - Multiple scrolls in same direction = locked
  - Change direction = new card move
- Result: Predictable, discrete navigation

### v1.7.8
- **PARADIGM SHIFT: Sticky header moment = Event 1 committed**
- User insight: "Scroll tracking starts when title sticks = 33% scrolled"
- When header becomes sticky (top <= 80px), Event 1 is locked in
- Base progress jumps to 33.3% at sticky moment
- Remaining spacer scroll maps to 33.3% → 100% (Events 2 & 3)
- Result: One visible scroll per event switch
  - Scroll to stick = Event 1
  - Next scroll = Event 2
  - Next scroll = Event 3
- Intuitive, predictable, matches visual state

### v1.7.7
- **ROOT CAUSE FIXED: Spacer height was causing massive scroll distances**
- Deep investigation revealed: 250vh spacer meant 1+ full viewport scroll per event
- Why "3 big scrolls" for first card: E0→E1 needed 40% of 250vh = 800px (1.0 viewport)
- Why "1 tiny one" for second: E1→E2 only needed 700px more (asymmetric!)
- Solution: Reduced spacer from 250vh to 100vh
- New distances: ~320px per event switch (~40% of viewport)
- Result: True swipe-like feel, equal distances, small scrolls register

### v1.7.6
- **FIXED: Instant scroll progress - eliminated dead zone at section entry**
- Root cause: Entry required section at 30% + spacer at 70%, plus 35%/50% offsets
- This created a "dead zone" where initial scrolling didn't register
- Fix: Changed entry to 50% from top, removed ALL scroll calculation offsets
- scrollProgress now starts at 0 instantly when section enters view
- Committed event initialized immediately (no delayed requestAnimationFrame)
- Result: Every scroll counts from the moment you enter - no wasted scrolling

### v1.7.5
- **NEW: Snap behavior for swipe-like card switching**
- 15% threshold: Small swipes (15% into next zone) commit to full event change
- Committed event tracking: Maintains current event until clear directional scroll
- Three snap triggers:
  - Forward snap at 15% into next zone
  - Backward snap at 85% back into previous zone
  - Full crossing at 50%+ into different zone
- Result: Responsive, card-swipe feel while maintaining equal zone distribution

### v1.7.4
- **REAL FIX: Removed scroll-snap interference and all artificial delays**
- Root causes identified:
  - CSS `scroll-snap-type: y proximity` was fighting manual zone calculations
  - Boundary threshold logic was backwards (blocked switches at zone entry)
  - Scroll lock mechanism added 250ms artificial delays
- Solution: Complete simplification
  - Removed CSS scroll-snap for full manual control
  - Pure zone calculation: `Math.floor(scrollProgress / 0.333)`
  - No locks, no thresholds, no delays
  - Removed 50+ lines of complex logic
- Result: Truly equal, instant, predictable scroll behavior

### v1.7.3
- **FIXED: Equal zone distribution for event scroll** - Each event now gets exactly 33.3% of scroll space
- Bug fix: Previous version had first card at 41.3%, Event 2 at 33.4%, Event 3 at 25.3%
- New algorithm: Pure zone-based calculation using `Math.floor(scrollProgress / zoneSize)`
- Added 2% boundary threshold to prevent flickering at exact zone transitions
- Resolves issue: "first card takes a lot to swipe and last card is almost nothing"
- Result: Intuitive, predictable, production-ready scroll behavior

### v1.7.2
- **Adjusted image sizing to 10% reduction** - Max-width reduced from 500px to 450px desktop (was 400px in v1.7.1)
